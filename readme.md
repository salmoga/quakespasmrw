This is my quakespasm total word for word rewrite, which I am
using to learn how to code quake. Eventually I hope to create
an integrated game engine complete with editor and all the
tools necessary to create a complete FPS like half life.

The tools will use modern formats unlike the original pcx and
other obscure garbage formats of the 90s. Perhaps even a simple
model editor/viewer will be included, while trenchbroom, blender,
old audacity and gimp will ensure a completely FOSS toolchain

Once I complete this project, I intend to then create a 
"Chocolate-Quake" like chocolate doom, since I feel like quake
has been robbed of alot of its appeal by its GL port.

Code released under the terms of the GPL version 3.
